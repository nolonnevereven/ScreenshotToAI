**Last Updated: December 2025**

## Overview

Screenshot to AI is a browser extension that captures screenshots and sends them to AI services (ChatGPT and Grok) for analysis. This extension is primarily designed for Japanese users.

### What the extension does:
- Captures screenshots of the currently visible tab (only when you click the capture button)
- Temporarily stores the screenshot in your browser's local storage
- Sends the screenshot to ChatGPT or Grok (based on your selection) by pasting it into their web interface
